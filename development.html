                        <div class="ln"></div>
                        <p>In March of 2019, I conceived “Something About to Happen”, a project that explored and brought awareness to the conditions we subject ourselves to while living in the suburbs, and the significant environmental and social implications of rapidly expanding suburban sprawl.
                            <br><br>
                            The book consisted of a short essay, as well as an extensive photographic collection that attempts to communicate the more abstruse emotional impact the suburbs have on its inhabitants. The project has grown to include a <a href="https://aidloc.github.io/archive/suburbs/index.html" target="_blank">website,</a> while the photographic series continues to grow as I refine my thesis.</p>

                        <p>I developed my thesis for this project through personal research, and also by interviewing members of my neighbourhood. The writing of the essay consisted of a very linear process of researching, interviewing, drafting and editing. The end result was a clean and informative written piece that outlined the problems of the suburbs and posed open-ended questions intended to place the reader in the same headspace as someone living within the suburbs.
                            <br><br>
                            The book design followed an iterative methodology of countless drafts to reach the final version. The photography, which is perhaps the most powerful part of the project, followed a more explorative methodology, working first in my house, then my neighbourhood, and then surrounding boroughs as I tried to translate my thoughts into images with as little direction to the models as possible.

                        <p>Lofidelitism is a fabricated artistic movement which was originally meant to represent a set of visual aesthetics and feelings present in lofi music. The project quickly expanded to explore the nature of memory and nostalgia, begging the question "what does a memory look like?".
                            <br><br>
                            Art of this nature aims to undermine the pompous art world by creating accessible and understandable art, that simply pleases the viewer, calms them, and helps them reach a happy place. The visuals avoid sharp and clear subjects in favour of highlighting recongizable symbols that anyone can connect to.</p>

                        <p>I aimed to design a book who's physical charachteristics were defined by the tenets of Lofidelitism. Riding somewhere between a family photo album &amp; a slick artbook. The images are made entirely from personal collections of my own photos, and are mashed together in groups to either evoke a certain mood, or act as a reminder of certain universal expe- riences. I aimed to create images that mimic how someone recalls a memory: unlike a film, but in a tactile sense, with strong elements and colors repeated, but lacking specific subjects.<br><br>
                            I played on the concept of a "light memory" by printing the images on vellum allowed light to pass through the book, and fostered dialogues between collages depending on the level of light in the room. Construction was challenging, but very rewarding in the end.

                        <div class="ln"></div>
                        <p>Once a year, the Concordia Faculty of Fine Arts Gallery arranges a multidisciplinary exhibition to showcase its talented undergraduate artists. I was fortunate to be a part of a team of four designers (Lily Minkova, Sam Laurin &nbsp; Lochlan Doyle) responsible for developing the catalogue, which acts as both an exhibition guide and an archive of the 2019/2020 exhibition.
                            <br><br>
                            In prior catalogues, due to the scheduling issues, the dancers had not been represented on the same level as the visual artists. I sought to change that, and arranged to photograph all of the early choreographies in progress.</p>

                        <p>Along with playing a key role in the development of the physical catalogue (pictured below), I took on the solo project of documenting the dancers work. One challenge faced during production was finding a way to equally represent the entire faculty, considering half of the choreographies documented would not be performed at the vernissage.<br><br>
                            My solution was to digitally stitch long exposure images of the dancers together to create visuals that encapsulate the general feel of the works, without excluding any members of the dance faculty.

                        <p>I wanted the layout to reflect the narrative as best as possible, and emphasize the duality of the conversations within. By printing in grayscale I was able to add a harsh contrast between the "she" and "him" charachters, highlighting certain passages in black. After shooting a variety of images to represent "she's" struggle, the images were painted over by artist Lauren Egli, to represent both "him's" unnatural expectations of "she" and the slow undermining of "she's" autonomy.

                        <p>While lacking of the cohesion of a carefully assembled project. Illustration has been an essential part of my practice for several years. Below you will find a selection of my favorites. Made for a variety of design challenges, small project and most noteably, for the <a href="thelinknewspaper.ca">Link Magazine</a> of which took on the role of Graphics Editor between 2018 - 2019. Enjoy!</p>
