            Once a year, the Concordia Faculty of Fine Arts Gallery arranges a multidisciplinary exhibition to showcase its talented undergraduate artists. I was fortunate to be a part of a team of four designers (Lily Minkova, Sam Laurin &amp; Lochlan Doyle) responsible for developing the catalogue, which acts as both an exhibition guide and an archive of the 2019/2020 exhibition.<br><br>
            In prior catalogues, due to the scheduling issues, the dancers had not been represented on the same level as the visual artists. I sought to change that, and arranged to photograph all of the early choreographic works in progress.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with developing the visual identity and layout of the physical catalogue (pictured below), I took on the solo project of documenting the dancers work. One challenge faced during production was finding a way to equally represent the entire faculty, considering half of the performances documented would not be performed at the vernissage.<br><br>
            My solution was to digitally stitch long exposure images of the dancers together to create visuals that encapsulate the general feel of the works, without excluding any members of the dance faculty.<br><br>
