        <p>
            In March of 2019, I conceived “Something About to Happen”, a project that explored and brought awareness to the conditions we subject ourselves to while living in the suburbs, and the significant environmental and social implications of rapidly expanding suburban sprawl.<br><br>
            The book consisted of a short essay, as well as an extensive photographic collection that attempts to communicate the more abstruse emotional impact the suburbs have on its inhabitants. The project has grown to include a website, while the photographic series continues to grow as I refine my thesis.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed my thesis for this project through personal research, and also by interviewing members of my neighbourhood. The writing of the essay consisted of a very linear process of researching, interviewing, drafting and editing. The end result was a clean and informative written piece that outlined the problems of the suburbs and posed open-ended questions intended to place the reader in the same head space as someone living within the suburbs.<br><br>
            The book design followed an iterative methodology of countless drafts to reach the final version. The photography, which is perhaps the most powerful part of the project, followed a more exploration based methodology, working first in my house, then my neighbourhood, and then surrounding boroughs as I tried to translate my thoughts into images with as little direction to the models as possible.<br><br>
