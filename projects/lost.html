            Lost Boy is a narrative work that centres on a character I’ve created, aptly titled “the lost boy”. The character is supposed to represent something we’ve all felt at one time or another. The lost boy should encourage a sense of empathy and longing, while simultaneously being recognized as something we all see in ourselves: lost. Disconnected from our environment and from the people around us, feeling like an alien or a ghost.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The way the character engages with the landscape is playful and innocent. Lost Boy is not of this earth, and he observes his environment, cautiously attempting to adopt the ways of
            the few people he sees around him in an attempt to fit in. To find their place in an unforgiving landscape. As we follow the Lost Boy, we witness both successes and failures as he attempts to achieve his goal. Whether he has found what he is looking for or not is left ambiguous, but what is clear is a temporary sense of completion, and an enduring peace and patience within the Lost Boy.<br><br>
