            An outlook on typography was a series of event posters meant to advertise fictional lecture by the esteemed typographer and designer Karel Martens. Naturally, the developed pieces were meant to pay homage to Martensâ€™ incredibly unique style. His works are diverse in nature, so naturally the series of posters covered mimicked his assorted techniques.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Working digitally, I was able to play on the metaphysical nature of his prints. Where he would show print borders and elements of his process in his final works, I integrated elements of my digital work environment as part of the final piece.<br><br>
