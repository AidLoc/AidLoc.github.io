            Lofidelitism, “lofi art”, is a style of collage and image making that I initially developed in fall 2018. The preliminary ideals of this style was to break down barriers of high, refined & complex art by creating something instantly understandable, that everyone could connect to on a fundamental level. Despite being based off of images from my childhood and various personal photo albums, the images are iterated upon, distorted and broken down to their base forms, common recognizable elements that pertain to a specific theme (some themes being a large city, the suburbs, hiking in a forest, the beach, etc.). As I continued to develop this style, I’ve come to realize fairly recently that the greatest success of this style is not that the components of the collage are easily recognizable, but instead that the collage is “post-visual”, it breaks all modern conventions of the image, there are endless planes and geometries. These collages are not simply collages, but photographs of what a memory might look like.<br><br>

            For this project I relied on computer vision and AI (select subject, select focal point, and smart selection tool in photoshop) to identify the most important features of the image. In doing this I’m further distancing these collages from classical image conventions, and trying to treat these images how a brain may treat them. I also sought to move beyond the 2D plane, a limiting factor in prior collages, considering that a memory doesn’t exist in a specific dimension, but is rather dimensionless. As a result, after creating my collages, I broke down the layers into individual files, and used the p5.js library to code a custom space for the collages to exist in. This allowed the viewer to dig into the collages and see even more details, as well as 1000’s of possible combinations, making these most recent collages all the more robust.<br><br>
