            MonstrARTity is a Mississauga based, not-for-profit creative community, responsible for organizing several South Asian art's and music festivals throughout the summer season, as well as deploying a series of youth and senior's programs throughout the entire year. For the past two seasons, I have been a member of the team as the lead graphic designer, in charge of executing large scale advertising campaigns under the direction of the PR & marketing lead. These campaigns included posters, flyers, newspaper advertisements, billboards, public transit ads, social media content, merchandise and video graphics. These assets needed to be prepared in rapid succession with a high degree of accuracy, with special consideration for the organization's internal brand guidelines as well as individual advertisers' specifications.<br><br>

        <p>
            MonstrARTity's image and brand are constantly evolving, but the tone has always been big, bold and over-the-top (in the best way possible). As a result, I had the opportunity to redesign a lot of the company's existing materials to better reflect this tone. A selection of some of my personal favourites are pictured below.<br><br>
