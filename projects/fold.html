                This short film deals with the idea of insecurity, how we battle it, defeat it, and how it often defeats us. Rather than make light of these challenging mental blocks, this composition communicates the perceived power these insecurities have, along with their ability to literally "distort" reality. Insecurities explored in this video include self-advocacy, a fear of the future, a fear of being forgotten, body image & paranoia. I structured the film around James Blake's "Don't Miss It", which chronicles the artist's own struggle with mental health, the lyrics were always very powerful to me, and many lines are reflected in the visuals.<br><br>
