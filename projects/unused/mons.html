            MonstrARTity is a Mississauga based not-for-profit, responsible for organizing several South Asian art's and music festivals throughout the summer season, as well as deploying a series of youth and senior's programs throughout the entire year. For the past two seasons, I have been a member of the team as the lead graphic designer, in charge of executing a plethora of assets. These assets included but were not limited to print marketing materials, billboards, public transit ads, digital marketing content, merchandise and video graphics.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            MonstrARTity's image and brand are constantly evolving, but the tone has always been big, bold and over-the-top (in the best way possible). As a result, I had the opportunity to redesign a lot of the company's existing materials to better reflect this tone. A modest selection of some of my personal favourites are pictured below.<br><br>
