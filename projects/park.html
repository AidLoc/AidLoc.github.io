            <p>
                One of my earliest professional design projects was work for the "Parks Beautification Project". The project sprang out of a municipal initiative to clean up local parks in the City of Mississauga, coupled with a project grant for Canada 150. This initiative involved designing and painting murals in various parks and public spaces. The murals helped bring colour and life to dull utility boxes. The boxes and spaces targeted were also frequent victims to vandalism, installing murals on these otherwise inviting blank canvases.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the supervision of coordinator Anna Ferguson, I was responsible for creating digital designs for the murals, developing necessary stencils, and overseeing a team of painters during the installation process. The team was often made up of local students and members of the community, this inclusion helps foster a sense of ownership for the parks, which help keep them safe and clean. Each design was heavily influenced by the history of the region of the city it was installed.
