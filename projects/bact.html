            In Bacterial Traces I intended to explore some of the invisible markers we leave behind as we traverse through spaces. As we walk, we contribute to a diverse bacterial ecosystem, invisible but very alive, on the floors or grounds we stand on. There are thousands of dimensions of experience, and as a result, thousands of modes of representation to communicate these dimensions. These alternate modes of representation, which may not follow traditional visual conventions, have the ability to communicate reality on a much deeper level than an ordinary image, painting, or other known depictions of reality.
            <br><br>
            In my project, I took 6 walks, 4 in Montreal and 2 in Sherbrooke, in each I began by thoroughly sanitizing my shoes and then proceeding on my walk or errand as usual. Following my walk, my shoe became a paint palette, and a sterile swab my paintbrush. Like invisible ink, I painted the path of my walk as best I could remember. I proceeded to document my plates twice daily for about 12 days, taking approximately ~150 photos. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            During this process, I got to watch my paintings grow into existence, flourishing with a diverse variety of bacteria, yeasts and moulds, all with unique colours and patterns. These snapshots shed a light on a "bacterial signature" of a location, developed through millions of walks and millions of people. These signatures are in constant flux and are communicate details about time, weather, people and geography.
            <br><br>
            I feel as though watching the bacteria grow is like watching footsteps or fingerprints appear on a once blank ground. The videos are accompanied by music from the experimental artist Blear Moon of their album split. The music uses thousands of layers of instruments and voices, in the context of bacterial colonies, I imagined that each individual instrument is the sound of a single colony, all merging together to create a beautiful and rich mosaic.
