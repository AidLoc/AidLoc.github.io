            <div id="content2">
                <p>I am a 20 year old graphic designer, photographer, and creator from Toronto, Ontario. I see myself as both a designer and an artist, and love taking opportunities to blend these practices in my work. I have trained as a multifaceted designer who is well versed in print design, industrial design, web design, photography, videography and 3D animation. I am a driven and team oriented individual and I hope I can bring a unique and fresh perspective to your team. Outside of the studio, I love to hike with my dog, take my camera for long walks, and cook in any of my remaining spare time. I am currently seeking both freelance jobs and longer term positions, I look forward to working with you!</p>

                Despite being an e-commerce super power, Shopify maintains an working culture and public image that is immensely appealing. Chief Executive Officer Tobias Lütke believes in solution design, and the importance of maintaining a diverse team of thinkers in order to develop the most intelligent solutions to design challenges. As the company grew from a 2 person operation working out of a coffee shop, so did the range of services offered by Shopify. The company began operations as a middle man for e-commerce, offering services to streamline payment and delivery of goods, now, Shopify acts as a “business builder”, offering a variety of marketing, design & business administration services.

            <p>Overall, Shopify promotes a very non-corporate and inviting office environment, and aims to break the mould in every sense of the phrase. They encourage individuality and prioritize personal comfort above all else, as this is the key to highest level of both creativity and productivity. While I don’t intend on operating as an e-commerce conglomerate, I intend to maintain the same level of flexibility and openness. I also plan to offer the same form of end to end service offered by Shopify, wherein my clients need only one point of contact for the entire design process. </p>
