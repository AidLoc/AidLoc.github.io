                    <h1>Lofidelitism</h1>
                    <p>Lofidelitism is a fabricated artistic movement which was originally meant to represent a set of visual aesthetics and feelings present in lofi and chill-hop music. Lofidelic art rides somewhere between hyper-real and a family photo album. Art of this nature aims to disassemble the pompous art world by creating accessible and understandable art, that simply pleases the viewer, calms them, and helps them reach a happy place. In an abstract sense, the visuals attempt to mimic what a memory might “look like”, blurring the sharp and clear picture in favour of focusing on and repeating certain details. </p>

                    <h1>Something About to Happen</h1>
                    <p>In March of 2019, I conceived “Something About to Happen”, a project that explored and brought awareness to the conditions we subject ourselves to while living in the suburbs, and the significant environmental and social implications of rapidly expanding suburban sprawl. The book consisted of a short essay, as well as an extensive photographic collection that attempts to communicate the more abstruse emotional impact the suburbs have on its inhabitants. The project has grown to include a website, while the photographic series continues to grow as I refine my thesis. </p>

                    <p>This project consisted of producing a conceptual book and supporting visuals for the experimental play FAILURES. A “DIDASCALOGUE” written by Concordia professor Dr. Louis Patrick Leroux. The play details the slow demise of a toxic relationship, laid out on a grand stage. To adequately represent the complex emotions of the play, I chose to photograph a woman (Emme Geryk) moving through the various stages of trauma as the relationship unravelled. The images were then painted over by artist Lauren Egli, to represent the ideological struggle between man and woman. The play consisted almost exclusively of the characters “HIM” and “SHE”, thus the layout (developed in collaboration with Lauren Egli) played on this duality. </p>

                    </h1>
                    <p>Once a year, the Concordia Faculty of Fine Arts Gallery arranges a multidisciplinary exhibition to showcase its talented undergraduate artists. I was fortunate to be a part of a team (Lily Minkova, Sam Laurin & Lochlan Doyle) of four designers responsible for developing the catalogue, which acts as both an exhibition guide and an archive of the 2019/2020 exhibition. The catalogue consisted of images of the works, essays, and images documenting dancers who interpreted the works put on display. In prior catalogues, due to the final performances not being selected until after the book is published, the dancers had not been represented on the same level as the visual artists. I sought to change that, and arranged to photograph all of the early works in progress, and stitched them together to create visuals that encapsulate the general feel of the works, without excluding any members of the dance faculty. </p>

                    <p>An outlook on typography was a series of event posters meant to advertise a lecture by the esteemed typographer and designer Karel Martens. Naturally, the developed pieces were meant to pay homage to Martens’ incredibly unique style. His works are diverse in nature, so naturally the series of posters covered mimicked his assorted techniques. Working digitally, I was able to play on the metaphysical nature of his prints. While he would show print borders and elements of his process in his final works, I integrated elements of my digital work environment, like bounding boxes, as part of the final piece. The final posters were printed in colour at 24x36 inches on a digital offset printer.</p>

                    <p>Monstrartity is a not-for-profit organization, based in Mississauga and committed to providing arts for the young and old alike. During the summer season, they put on a variety of high traffic cultural festivals. As their print designer, I was responsible for crafting a variety of promotional content including posters, flyers, bus &nbsp; subway banners, social media graphics, merchandise, tickets and sponsorship packages. My most comprehensive project to date, what was most challenging during my period working at Monstrartity was developing content that encapsulated all the details of such a complicated festival, while also managing to pay homage to the incredible number of sponsors a not-for-profit relies on. </p>
